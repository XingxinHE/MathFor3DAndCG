# Essential Math for 3D Programming and Computer Graphics



This repository initially is for my study notes of Linear Algebra. As demand, I felt compelled to have **1** unique repository for all the essential mathematics for 3D programming and Computer Graphics:

- [Linear Algebra](./linear_algebra/README.md)
- [Single Variable Calculus](./single_variable_calculus/README.md)
- [Multivariable Calculus](./multivariable_calculus/README.md)
- [Differential Equations](./differential_equations/README.md)
- Numerical Optimization



Stay tune...
